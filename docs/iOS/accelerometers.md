# Accelerometers

This section groups the APIs for raw accelerometer sampling and recorded accelerometer data.

## Included items
- Getting raw accelerometer events: Obtain unprocessed accelerometer samples from the hardware.
- CMAccelerometerData: A single accelerometer sample for the device's three axes.
- CMRecordedAccelerometerData: One recorded accelerometer sample captured by the system.
- CMSensorRecorder: Starts recording and later retrieves stored accelerometer data.
- CMSensorDataList: A collection of recorded accelerometer samples returned by the system.
